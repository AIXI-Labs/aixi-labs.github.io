Resources for learning about AIXI, Solomonoff induction, and related topics.

## Historical Foundations

[<img src="{{ '/assets/img/raysolomonoff.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Ray Solomonoff" class="founder-portrait" />](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/13/6/1076)

**Ray Solomonoff** (1926–2009) founded algorithmic probability—the theory that underlies Solomonoff induction and, ultimately, AIXI. His universal prior M(x) formalizes Occam's razor: simpler hypotheses receive higher prior probability.

## Reading Group

We hold regular online meetings on Solomonoff induction, AIXI, and related topics. Open to the public.

## Key Resources

- **[Universal Algorithmic Intelligence (UAI Book)](https://www.hutter1.net/ai/uaibook2.htm)** — Marcus Hutter's comprehensive introduction to Solomonoff induction, AIXI, and related theory.
- **[InfoTheory](https://github.com/turtle261/infotheory)** — An algorithmic information theory library implementing approximations, estimators, and a comprehensive MC-AIXI agent platform (ROSA, CTW, RWKV backends).
