## Our Values

- **Rigour** — We prioritize high-quality, methodical research grounded in formal models, and embrace negative results that identifying flaws in safety proposals—our own and others'.
- **Transparency** — We share our work openly where possible, including failures and dead ends.
- **Openness** — We remain open to exploring new ideas and abandoning or revisiting old ones.
- **Collaboration** — We believe progress requires coordination across the field.
- **Impact** — We focus on research that meaningfully reduces risk. To develop results that are robust instead of superficial, we value foundational work whose payoffs may not be immediate.
