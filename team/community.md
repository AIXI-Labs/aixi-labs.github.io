## Events

We are hoping to launch a research symposium or conference soon, similar to the one in [2025](https://sites.google.com/site/boumedienehamzi/second-symposium-on-algorithmic-information-theory-and-machine-learning).

## Join Our Reading Group

We hold regular online meetings on Solomonoff induction, AIXI, and related topics. Open to the public.
