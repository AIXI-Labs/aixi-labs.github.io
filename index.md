**AIXI** is the leading mathematical model of artificial superintelligence, representing the maximum theoretical limit of AI capabilities. The **AI X-risk Institute** models AI risk factors and safety mitigations in terms of AIXI variants, and develops the means to translate them to real AI agents. This enables rigorous testing of both the risk factors and the safety mitigations.
